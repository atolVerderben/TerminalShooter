# Terminal Shooter
![alt text](/screenshots/terminalshooterss1.png "ScreenShot 1")


## Summary
An arena shooter inside the terminal. Currently only against the AI.

## Why?
I first started this game for the Linux Game Jame 2017.
I picked a terminal approach because with the time allotted for the jam and between work and kids I just didn't have the time to worry about art assets. I wasn't content with just "another roguelike" in the terminal, so I wanted something more action based. I'd never played a shooter in the terminal so I set out to change that.


## Future Tasks
* Fluid UI experience
* Lots of code clean up (Game Jams make sloppy code)
* Different weapons
* More arenas
* LAN Support
  * Ideally Internet Multiplayer as well
