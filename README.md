# TerminalShooter
A terminal arena shooter game. First started for the Linux Game Jame 2017.
This was originally just a fun idea to use something so simple I wouldn't even need to use art for, 
that was inorder to fit in the time frame I was given. Also between my job and kids...
## Future Tasks
* LAN Support
  * Ideally Internet Multiplayer as well
* More than 2 players
* More intelligent AI (as in a real AI system!)
